	        It is sponsored by the International Society for Universal Dialogue  and by the Philosophy for Dialogue Foundation.
	        It is published by the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences and by the Philosophy for Dialogue Foundation.
	        Since 2019 Dialogue and Universalism is published three times a year.

	      <h1>Aims and Scope</h1>
        <div class="textcontainer">
	        <p>
	        Dialogue and Universalism publishes philosophical articles from all philosophical traditions and domains.
	        Dialogue and Universalism tends to show that philosophy is an essential eternal domain of human culture and an inevitable element of the nowadays human world.
	        The metaphilosophical diversity is admitted as it is believed that dialogue, discussions, also clashing between philosophical traditions, schools and attitudes as well as drawing in philosophizing from other kinds of human knowledge lead to a synergy effect which develops and enhances philosophy as a whole.
	        Dialogue and Universalism aims to demonstrate that philosophy plays a participative role: its conceptions, diagnoses and ideals impact or/and should impact the human world.

	        The ISUD community is convinced that philosophy has an important role to play in the struggle for the future of humanity.
	        Critical and creative rational thinking is an opportunity for humankind to resist the lies and illusions of ideological manipulations that serve as instruments of enslavement and oppression.
	        This open and broad vision of philosophy as an expression of human rationality offers a chance to free people’s awareness, to open their minds, and to extend their possibilities of thinking and acting.
	        In doing so, philosophical reflection is able to refine and renew old ideals and values as well as to create new ones.
          It is these two aspects — free consciousness and new ideals — that are necessary to build a more decent human world. 
          Philosophy with its amazingly sophisticated ways of thinking disposes a tremendous power to cope with the world and to change it.
	        Philosophy is free from technical and practical interests, and constituted by the pursuit of removing — from a highly distanced and neutral perspective — falsehood, prejudices, mental, cultural, religious and social slavery. 
	        So it gives a hope for human beings’ emancipation as well as for an alteration of the world, first spiritual, and then material.
